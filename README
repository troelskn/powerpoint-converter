Automated conversion of ppt, using PowerPoint
---

Sorry, but you're mostly on your own for now.

Quick hints:

* This is only tested on Windows 7 + PowerPoint2010
* Copy files from worker dir to some place on your Windows machine. For example c:/pp-converter
* Copy config-example.json to config.json and edit the uri
* Install Ruby (1.9.3+)
* gem install win32-service
* Follow these obscure instructions to work around a bug in Power Point: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1006923/automating-office-via-windows-service-on-server-2008/1680214#1680214
* From a command prompt, run ruby daemon.rb install

That's it for the worker.

You'll also need a server component running on the uri specified in config.json.
